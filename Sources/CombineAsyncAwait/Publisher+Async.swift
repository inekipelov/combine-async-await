// MARK: - Publisher Async Extensions

public extension Publisher {
    /**
     Retrieves the most recent value emitted by the publisher as an async value.
     
     This method bridges Combine's callback-based API with Swift's async/await, using
     a checked throwing continuation to suspend execution until the publisher completes.
     
     Technical Details:
     - The method uses `withCheckedThrowingContinuation` to resume the async context once 
       the publisher either emits a value or completes.
     - A cancellation handler (`withTaskCancellationHandler`) is incorporated to react immediately 
       if the surrounding task is cancelled.
     - Internally, it subscribes via `sink`, capturing the last emitted value before the publisher 
       completes. If the publisher completes without emitting a value, the function throws the 
       `EmptyAsyncError`.
     - Note: Starting with Swift 5.5 and further enhanced in Swift 5.7, Swift provides a built-in 
       construct (`publisher.values`) that allows reacting to every signal emitted by a publisher 
       as an async sequence. This can be used to process each value individually in a for-await-in loop.
     
     - Returns: The last value emitted by the publisher before completion.
     - Throws: The publisherâ€™s error, or `EmptyAsyncError` if the publisher completes without emitting any value.
